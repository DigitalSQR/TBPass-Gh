Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/problem-type-loinc,ValueSet/observation-codes,ValueSet/document-classcodes,ValueSet/doc-section-codes,ValueSet/observation-vitalsignresult,ValueSet/doc-typecodes,ValueSet/condition-severity-uv-ips"
